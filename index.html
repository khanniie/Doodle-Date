        Hello internet! I made this project many years ago in high school when I
        was first learning how to code. Truthfully, I thought no one would ever
        use it. <br /><br />
        I checked the database again after getting emails from the database
        service, and was so suprised to find out that people had been using it!
        Although I'm so happy this tool was useful for a small number of people,
        This was a student project from 2017, and many better versions of the
        same concept have been released since then.

          >I'd strongly suggest using a more modern collaborative canvas like
          <a href="https://aggie.io/">aggie.io</a></b
        >
        <br /><br />
        <b
          >I'm going to deprecate this project for now and close off the
          database to any new entries. That means that although the pages are
          still there, you won't be able to draw anymore.</b
        >
        I'll leave the database as is, so if you still remember your room code,
        you can still view the drawings.
        <br /><br />
        If you'd like to save past drawing info or really want to keep using the
        site, message me and I'll see what I can do :)
        <br /><br />
        Goodbye and thank YOU! Please feel free to reach out (I'm crabbage_ on
        twitter!) - I never properly set up username storage so I have no clue
        who's been using this and am so curious (How did you even find this?)!
        <br /><br />
        All the best,
